You can also \"change\" options such as the number of decks (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8) or whether surrender is allowed or not.\n\nThere is also a triple seven progressive side bet.  For a 5 dollar side bet, you win if your first, first two, or first three cards are sevens.  Got three sevens?  Then you win the progressive jackpot, which increases based on aggregate play of this skill!  Play with your friends and really watch that jackpot grow!\n\nAt any time, you can ask to \"read the rules\" or \"repeat\" to hear the current rules in play or to repeat your hand and bankroll.  If you need to reset the game to its original state and rules of play, say \"reset game.\"\n\nCompare your bankroll with other players by saying \"read high scores\" to hear the leader board.
