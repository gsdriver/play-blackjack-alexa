          "description": "Spiele mit deinen Freunden Blackjack mit Alexa! Du kannst mit bis zu 3 Freunden an einem Tisch gegen die Bank spielen. Wenn du willst, kannst du dabei Echo Buttons verwenden, um immer zu wissen, wer gerade an der Reihe ist. \n\nDie Bankroll jedes Spielers wird gespeichert. Auch wenn du mehrere Runden Blackjack spielst, kannst du deine Bankroll immer im Auge behalten. Bei jedem neuen Spiel lässt sich die Spielerzusammenstellung am Tisch ändern. \n\nZu Beginn hast du 5000 Dollar zur Verfügung. Dein Einsatz kann zwischen 5 und 1000 Dollar liegen. \n\nVerbessere deine Blackjack Skills, in dem du vor deinen Zügen um Hinweise bittest (\"Was soll ich tun?\") oder indem du im Trainingsmodus spielst (\"Trainingsmodus anschalten\"), in dem Alexa dir vor jedem Zug sagt, was basierenden auf den aktuell angewandten Spielregeln die beste Taktik ist.  \n\nDieses umfangreiche Spiel bietet alle Spieloptionen -  Hit, Stand, Split, Double Down und Surrender.  Du kannst Optionen \"ändern\" und zum Beispiel die Anzahl von Decks bestimmen (1, 2, 4, 6, oder 8) oder festlegen, ob das Aufgeben erlaubt ist oder nicht.\n\nAußerdem gibt es eine optionale Triple Seven Zusatzwette. Mit einem Einsatz von 5 Dollar gewinnst du bei der Zusatzwette, wenn deine erste Karte, deine ersten beiden Karten oder deine ersten drei Karten alle Siebenen sind. Hast du drei Siebenen? Dann hast du den Jackpot gewonnen, der mit jeder Zusatzwette wächst. Spiele mit deinen Freunden, um den Jackpot noch weiter ansteigen zu lassen. \n\nDu kannst jeder Zeit \"Lies die Regeln vor\" sagen, um die gerade angewandten Regeln zu hören. Oder bitte um eine \"Wiederholung\", wenn du deinen letzten Spielzug wiederholen willst. \n\nWenn du das Spiel in den Originalzustand zurückversetzen und zu den Originalregeln wechseln willst, sage dann \"Spiel zurücksetzen\". \n\nVergleiche deine Bankroll mit denen der anderen Spieler und sage \"Lies die High Scores vor\", um die aktuelle Rangliste zu hören. Wenn du immer weiterspielst, schaffst du es vielleicht an die Spitze! \n\nHast du Feedback an uns oder wünscht dir für die Zukunft weitere Features?
